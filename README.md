# tribute-page

A tribute page dedicated to Johann Sebastian Bach. This is part of the Responsive Web Design Projects for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page).

This page was built using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. In the final project below, I incorporated Node.js, Express.js and EJS to become more familiar with the skills I learnt in [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com). This page is now hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) servers.

- [Tribute Page](https://mysterious-lake-91647.herokuapp.com/) - Final result of the project.
